My worked out examples from "The C programming Language" book

Why ?
=====

Well, y'know, being an Enterprise Java programmar and all that could sometimes take a toll on your soul and can drive 
oneself to relearn C again or it could be because I don't have any other better things to do with my time and 
burying myself in KnR book exercises could be a better alternative :P
